# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning. We explore the Titanic dataset, perform data preprocessing, train various machine learning models, and evaluate their accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features like age, gender, ticket class, and more. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Contents

- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, including:
- Data shape and columns
- Checking for missing values
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Data visualization

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature selection
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## Machine Learning Models

We trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including:
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes

## Model Evaluation

We evaluated each model using accuracy and generated a comparison plot to visualize their performance.

## Usage

You can run the Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`) to reproduce the analysis and predictions.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the Titanic dataset and demonstrates how various machine learning models can be used to predict survival outcomes.

Feel free to explore the notebook for detailed code and analysis.

Happy coding!
