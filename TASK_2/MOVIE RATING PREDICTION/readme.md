# Movie Rating Prediction

This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using machine learning techniques. We explore and analyze a dataset containing information about movies, including features like duration, genre, director, and actors. The goal is to build regression models that can predict movie ratings accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various attributes of movies, such as duration, genre, director, and actor information. The target variable is the movie's rating, which we aim to predict.

## Contents

- `Movie_Rating_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, including data distribution, missing values, and relationships between features and movie ratings.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. We also scale and transform features for modeling.

## Regression Models

We train and evaluate various regression models, including:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression

We use cross-validation to assess the models' performance on the training data and evaluate their performance on the test set.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate the models using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) on both cross-validation and the test set.

## Insights

- Predicting the exact movie rating is challenging, as it depends on various factors beyond the dataset's scope, such as the movie's plot and audience preferences.
- Actors and directors can influence a movie's rating, but other factors like marketing and storyline play crucial roles.

## Usage

You can run the Jupyter Notebook (`Movie_Rating_Prediction.ipynb`) to reproduce the analysis and predictions. Feel free to explore the notebook for detailed code and analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into predicting movie ratings using machine learning. While the models offer valuable predictions, they do not capture all factors influencing a movie's success. The dataset and models can be further refined and extended for more accurate predictions.

Happy movie rating prediction!
