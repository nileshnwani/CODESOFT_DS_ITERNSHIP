# Sales Prediction Using Python

This project demonstrates sales prediction using linear regression in Python. It utilizes a dataset containing advertising budgets for TV and corresponding sales to build a linear regression model. The model predicts sales based on TV advertising budgets and provides insights into the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, named "advertising.csv," includes information on TV advertising budgets and sales. It allows us to explore how advertising budgets impact sales.

## Contents

- `SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `advertising.csv`: The dataset used for the project.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project starts with exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics. It includes summary statistics, missing value checks, and visualizations to gain insights.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and preparing the data for model training.

## Model Building

A linear regression model is built to predict sales based on TV advertising budgets. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).

## Model Visualization

The project visualizes the linear regression model's fit by plotting actual vs. predicted sales values.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into sales prediction using linear regression. It demonstrates the impact of TV advertising budgets on sales and showcases the use of machine learning for business decision-making.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook (`SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON.ipynb`) for detailed code and analysis.

Optimize your advertising strategies and make data-driven decisions with this sales prediction model!
