# Iris Flower Classification

This project focuses on the classification of iris flowers using machine learning techniques. We explore and analyze the famous Iris dataset, consisting of features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, with the target being the iris species.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is commonly used for classification and machine learning. It includes three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The goal is to build a classification model to predict the species based on the flower's measurements.

## Contents

- `Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, including data distribution, summary statistics, and visualizations. This helps us understand the relationships between features and species.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include label encoding, handling missing values (if any), and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. We ensure the data is ready for model training.

## Model Building

We build a classification model using various algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

We evaluate these models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Visualizations

We create visualizations, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, to better understand the data distribution and relationships between features. These visualizations provide insights into the differences between iris species.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the classification of iris flowers using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates the process of data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. The models' performance metrics provide valuable insights into their accuracy in predicting iris species based on flower measurements.
